# Builder.io + React Project

This is a React application integrated with Builder.io's Visual CMS.

## What Was Fixed

The project had several issues that have been resolved:

1. **Missing Dependencies**: All required dependencies were not installed. Fixed by running `npm install`.

2. **Incorrect Builder CLI Setup**: The project was trying to use a non-existent `builder dev` command. This has been fixed by:

   - Installing the correct `@builder.io/dev-tools` package
   - Updating the `dev` script to use `react-scripts start`
   - Properly integrating Builder.io into the React app

3. **Missing Builder.io Integration**: Added proper Builder.io integration in `App.js` with the `BuilderComponent`.

## Getting Started

1. **Install dependencies** (already done):

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Get your Builder.io API key**:

   - Sign up at [Builder.io](https://builder.io)
   - Go to [Account Settings](https://builder.io/account/organization)
   - Copy your API key

3. **Update the API key**:

   - Open `src/App.js`
   - Replace `YOUR_BUILDER_API_KEY_HERE` with your actual API key

4. **Start the development server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   # or
   npm start
   ```

## Available Scripts

- `npm start` / `npm run dev` - Starts the development server
- `npm run build` - Creates a production build
- `npm test` - Runs tests
- `npm run eject` - Ejects from Create React App (not reversible)

## Using Builder.io

Once you've set up your API key:

1. Create content in the Builder.io visual editor
2. The content will automatically appear in your React app
3. Use the `BuilderComponent` to render different content models

For more information, check out the [Builder.io React documentation](https://www.builder.io/c/docs/react).
